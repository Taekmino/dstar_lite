#Path Planner : D* Lite
The dummy node publishes a randomly generated subgoal, current location, and map. 

Change parameters in dummy.launch for experiments in various environments.
If you change the parameters in a roslaunch file, then run the following command.
```bash
roslaunch path_planner dummy.launch
roslaunch path_planner path_planner.launch
```
